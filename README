Template-Plugin-Lingua-EN-Inflect
=================================

The Lingua::EN::Inflect is an interface to Damian Conway's
Linua::EN::Inflect Perl module, which provides plural inflections,
"a"/"an" selection for English words, and manipulation of numbers as words.

The plugin provides an 'inflect' filter, which can be used to
interpolate inflections in a string.  The NUM() function sets a
persistent default value to be used whenever an optional number
argument is omitted.  The number to be used for a particular
invocation of 'inflect' can also be specified with a 'number' option.
